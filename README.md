# HW3PWGenerator


This homework was a bit difficult. As someone mentioned in class, a major stumbling block with JS is that it's hard to start from scratch. With HTML and CSS, there's and the elements do things in a demonstrable way. Javascript requires a lot more forethought. As was mentioned, starting with the pseudocode is very useful. 

One thing I did that was helpful was to add an input list. This was better, and it felt a bit more professional looking than window prompts.This provided me an opportunity to use the *blur* event listener, which i had hitherto not heard of. If you enter something that is smaller than 8 or bigger than 128 for the password length, the button is disabled and let's you know if the password is too short or long. 

I was able to get a string into the password field, but the hard part is putting in the special characters at a random point (and not just at the end).
